This page is nothing more than a public posting of some of my personal notes on
stuff I like or intend to check out. Normally, I would keep these notes
privately but I figured some of the content is of interest to other people in
my social circle.

For now I'm hastily getting the content together, and I'll worry about the
presentation later.
